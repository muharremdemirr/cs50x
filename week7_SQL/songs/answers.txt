If a person listens songs that have high energy and dancebility average. We can say that person has a dynamic
characteristic since the songs he/she listens promote people to move.
If a person listens songs that have low valance we can say the person is dark.
Union of these values make us say the person is dark, but dynamic or cheerful, but lazy etc.


In the second question in my points of view the duration and play count is more important than the averages of those
values. For instance, Spotify says that Duman is my favorite band. (Duman is a Turkish music band, the word means smoke)
Actually, I don't listen Duman a lot. I usually put next button when it comes, but I have some songs of them in the list.
