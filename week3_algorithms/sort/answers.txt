sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:  I tested all the algorithms by time command.
I identified  sort1 uses bubble sort. Since that is is the worst at the large dataset. However it's the
algorithm that give the almost best performance at sorted datasets.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: I identified  sort2 as merge sort. Since the second sort is better than the others by far.
Especially at the big dataset. Moreover, it gives almost same performance for all three types of dataset.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: I identified  sort3 as selection sort, because it's way better than sort1 however it's
worst than sort2 by far. Also, it doesn't change a lot by types of datasets and it's characteristics of
selection sort.
